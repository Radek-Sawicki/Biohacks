Latest progress: The program can now identify bad columns according to the first of 
the 3 criteria - that at least 50% of amino acids are unique. A little question mark
is whther this means how many unique letters there is or how many of the letters are unique.
I take the second approach. 

The program further successfully removes all columns judged as bad from the dictionary. 
The badness assignment still needs to incorporate the 2 other criteria.
