Treedistmetric.py is the new script for computing distance between phylo trees. 
Work in hectic progress. Having trouble designing how the huge amounts of data files will be 
read automatically but at the moment I see a light in the end of the tunnel. It might work
using the command ">treedistmetric.py *.tree" in Unix, the script is designed for it as to date.
