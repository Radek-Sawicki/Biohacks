•	Found out that treedistmetric.py couldn’t read the reference trees because the regex was not matching it. This led to a significant renewal of the script which also made it more robust as I noticed that the regex wouldn’t have accepted newlines in any tree lines before.

•	treedistmetric.py now computes the distances successfully against the reference trees.
